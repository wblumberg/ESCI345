This directory contains t/z/vmr field data from the FASCOD model

- 5 atmospheric scenarios for different seasons and geographic locations (out of originally 6 scenarios - US Standard is currently missing)
- 1D fields given 0-95km (originally: 0-120km)

- complemented by "expanded" t/z fields covering altitudes up to 2000km. These have been consistently created for use with the IRI and IGRF data, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and a constant temperature (within the profile as well as for all the 5 scenarios) at altitudes above 95km. NOTE: When using these data, it is highly recommended to use ARTS' z_fieldFromHSE method for adjusting the calculation z_field to hydrostatic equilibrium conditions (the ARTS internal z-over-p interpolation does not conserve this; enforcing hydrostatic equilibrium by applying z_fieldFromHSE brings back the z data closer to the original profile).
